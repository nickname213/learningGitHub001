### GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes files from a GitHub repository and publishes them as a website. It is often used to host personal or project websites, but it can also be used to create a website for a GitHub organization or user.

To create a GitHub Pages site, you need to have a repository with a branch called gh-pages. You can create a new branch called gh-pages from the master branch of your repository.

Once you have a gh-pages branch, you can add a .gitignore file to the root of your repository to prevent GitHub Pages from ignoring the files in the gh-pages branch.

You can then add a CNAME file to the root of your repository to specify a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site.

You can then add a README.md file to the root of your repository to provide information about your GitHub Pages site.

You can then add a LICENSE file to the root of your repository to specify the license for your GitHub Pages site.

You can then add a .nojekyll file to the root of your repository to prevent GitHub Pages from processing Jekyll files.

You can then add a Gemfile to the root of your repository to specify the gems that your site depends on.
